1. Every study should create one [experiment tracker](../terms/exp.md)
    <ol type="a">
        <li><b>Timing</b>: Start on this right away; no need to take the Decision Tree Quiz ahead of time</li>
        <li><b>Content</b>: Lists all experiments/activities in the study, including high-level description, experimental questions, and hypotheses</li>
        <li><b>Purpose</b>: Gives a high-level overview of what the study was trying to ask/answer and how it went about answering that (more detailed than SLMD)</li>
    </ol>

2. Every study should create one [resource tracker](../terms/resource.md)
    <ol class="lower-alpha">
        <li><b>Timing</b>: Take Decision Tree Quiz first; note recommendations from quiz regarding <b>how</b> your study should implement the resource tracker</li>
        <li><b>Content</b>: Lists all/shared study artefacts and dependencies</li>
        <li><b>Purpose</b>:
            <ol class="lower-roman">
                <li><b>Interpreting, using, replicating</b>: Gives information on all/shared study artefacts, what items are shared, where/how to find it, how to understand/interpret it, how to use it, how different teams relate to each other, how different items relate to the dataset and/or results the study group will share (useful for potential secondary data users and originating study group which may need to reference/replicate past experiments/results across people and time)
                <li><b>Submitting to a repository</b>: Can allow reconfiguration of file organization for sharing both in location and time based on type of item (e.g., data, metadata, code), access level (permanent private, temporary private, restricted access, public), date of access level change (e.g., shared access date) - when submitting to a repository with robust API infrastructure, can allow for automated submission with interpretable organization and respecting all access settings
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>How your study should implement the resource tracker</b> will depend on at least three dimensions:
            <ol class="lower-roman">
                <li><b>Stage of accumulation of study artefacts</b>: Have already accumulated many study artefacts <b>OR</b> have accumulated relatively few study artefacts

                </li>
