Benefit for Secondary Users \u00b6 The focus here is on creating data packages suitable for submission to a public data repository to permit replication of a previous analysis and/or secondary analyses. Such packages include the information necessary to make the data findable , accessible , interoperable and reusable ( FAIR ). In particular, they (1) include metadata that may be indexed and searched to permit researchers to find the data; (2) organize and store data and supporting files using common, open standards and formats that make them easy to use; and (3) include sufficient documentation, including information on provenance and data use requirements and restrictions, to permit researchers to understand and reuse the data. Benefit for Originating study group & Data Packages without data \u00b6 Importantly, while data packages are the best way to share primary research data with potential secondary users, they are also useful for the originating study group AND they are also useful even when the originating study group is generating data that cannot be shared or is working with secondary data that cannot be redistributed . A data package provides an ideal way to organize your work locally, increasing the efficiency and reproducibility of your own work and facilitating collaboration among your team. In addition, a data package may be easily modified to exclude all or some of the data themselves\u2014possibly replacing them with links to their sources in the case of secondary data or with synthetic data\u2014leaving you with a product that can then be shared in order to document your work and permit other researchers to replicate your analysis. Navigating this guide \u00b6 The material in this guide is organized into four main sections. The first section provides a general overview of data packages, including what they are, why they're useful, and when and how to make one. The second section is a step-by-step tutorial on creating your first data package, with instructions tailored to your own situation based on your answers to three simple questions. The third section is a step-by-step tutorial on preparing your first data package for submission to a public data repository, with instructions tailored to your own situation based on your answers to three simple questions.

Files that will not be shared are documented as permanent-private. This type of annotation works best paired with 'as you go' annotation , as it easier an less time consuming to annotate wholistically, retrospectively, as part of 'top-down' annotation . Although this mode of annotation is more time consuming, it maximizes transparency and allows investigators interested in the data to understand the full scope of the project when accessing study documentation on the Platform. This structure also allows for documentation of the existence and disposition of files that are too sensitive to share but are important for reproducibility and can perhaps be requested directly from the study team by an investigator. Who may choose to share this way Study groups that have not started collecting data or are very early in the data collection process. Study groups that are earlier in the process and are interested in understanding and implementing a file and folder structure that facilitates data sharing in the future. Study groups that want to maximise the amount of information that they share about their study. Pros to sharing this way You get the benefit of full local annotation, which not only maximizes the usefulness of your data for other investigators but also can be helpful internally, especially in preserving knowledge about the data even as team members may change over the course of the study. Although more time consuming at the beginning, integration of this process into your workflows allows for documentation and annotation in parts as you move through the study, so that you do not need to compile all that information at the end of the study, retrospectively. Documenting and sharing all metadata associated with your study can increase the discoverability of your study. Cons to sharing this way More time consuming, because it requires you to set up the structures to fully catalogue all data and non-data/supporting files that are relevant to your study. Notes about wholistic annotation If you are early in your study and choose to pursue wholistic annotation, we recommend you consider reviewing and implementing [HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming of study artefacts]. This will ease the process of annotation as well as future data sharing. If you are annotating wholistically, you will also document dependencies 'one-layer-deep'. For more information, see Resource Tracker: Associated Files/Dependencies and 'One Layer Deep' Dependencies . Minimal annotation of study artefacts \u00b6 Minimal annotation starts with the main product(s) you are focused on sharing, whether that is a publication, presentation, or dataset, and works backwards. Rather than documenting all files, you document only the data and non-data file dependencies required to reproduce the final results or dataset. This is likely more ideal for studies that may be close to data collection completion and are not focused on meeting data sharing requirements but do not have adequate funding or time to devote the complete documentation of the data. This type of annotation pairs well with \u2018top-down\u2019 annotation , which retrospectively annotates study artefacts. Who may choose to share this way Study groups that may be finished or close to finished collecting data and have already produced results files (e.g., figures, draft publications/NIH reports, etc.) Study groups that want to meet minimal data sharing requirements of sharing data underlying published results Pros to sharing this way You only catalog the data and non-data/supporting files that you will share/submit to a repository. This is less work than fully cataloguing all data and non-data/supporting files relevant to a study (including files you will not share/submit to a repository), especially if the study is well underway or complete/nearing completion and/or does not have resources or time set aside for a complete file inventory. This approach allows you to fulfill the minimal data sharing requirements of sharing data underlying published results.

Notes about minimal annotation Even if you are not early in your study and are pursuing minimal annotation, we do not recommend reorganizing all your files or folder structures. However, we do recommend you consider reviewing and implementing naming conventions for like files, detailed in [HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming study artefacts].

practicable to implement (without duplicating original files), organize all study files/resources into a single study folder/directory (study folder/directory may of course have sub-directories; see here for guidance on and examples of recommended study folder/directory structure) If you have sets of \"like\" files (e.g. a similarly formatted tabular data file or brain imaging file per study subject per study timepoint), it may be well worth establishing file naming and organization conventions based on HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming study files/resources now and back-applying them just for these file sets - doing so may make it possible/easier to annotate these file sets in one go instead of annotating them singly one at a time, and so may substantially

consider three key questions : How far along are you in your study? What is your data-sharing goal? Do you have low or no resources to devote to data-sharing efforts? Next steps \u00b6 Move through the \"best fit\" questions below . Select and record the answer option to each question that best fits you and your study. Based upon your study's answer selections, detailed guidance on how and when to create and complete your data package will be provided. The questions \u00b6 Study Stage \u00b6 How far along are you in your study? How far along you are in your study when you start to think about data sharing will affect how you document your data. For example, if you are near the beginning of your study, you may be able to create your data package and set up documentation processes such that you document as you move through your study. This will lead to more complete documentation and ease the process of data sharing in the future, as opposed to completing all documentation at the end of your study. If you are nearer the end of your study, we recommend you take a narrower, more goal-oriented approach to documentation to minimize data sharing burden on your study group, while maximizing value to potential secondary data users and collaboraters. There are two options available for study stage. These study stage options are greatly simplified. For now, select the study stage that most closely fits with the stage you are at in your study . Value options Early Late Data-sharing Orientation \u00b6 What is your data-sharing goal? Determining what your goals are for data sharing will help guide you in determining what you will include in your future data package and how you will annotate the data and non-data supporting files/resources in your data package. People will have different goals in sharing data and non-data supporting files/resources from their study. These goals, or 'orientations' may be dictated by a number of factors such as the nature of the data, study staff resources and time constraints, and investigator preference. There are two main data sharing \"orientations.\" These data sharing goals or \"orientations\" are not mutually exclusive. You may choose both Results-support and Dataset-sharing as goals for your study's data sharing goal. See more about each data sharing orientation below, and select the data-sharing orientation(s) that most closely fit(s) with your study group's data sharing goals. Value options Results-support Dataset-sharing Data-sharing Resources \u00b6 Do you have low or no resources to devote to data sharing efforts? While it is sometimes the case that study groups don't explicitly budget and plan resources for data sharing efforts, many study groups have enough resources overall that they find they can still set some staff time and effort aside for data sharing efforts that will benefit potential secondary data users, the entire research community, and the originating study group. However in some cases, a study group may find themselves with a particularly low level of resources available to devote to data sharing efforts at the time they begin to consider fulfilling data sharing requirements attached to their study. They may for example have started out with a pretty tight study budget, or have already spent down most or all of the study budget, or have staff turnover that makes it difficult to spare person-time to the effort. Determining whether your study group may be in a more common position of having a standard level of resources available for data-sharing efforts, or whether your study group may be in the less common position of having a very low level of resources available will help guide you in determining how you will annotate the data and non-data supporting files/resources in your data package. There are two options available for data-sharing resources. These data-sharing resources options are greatly simplified.

While it is sometimes the case that study groups don't explicitly budget and plan resources for data sharing efforts, many study groups have enough resources overall that they find they can still set some staff time and effort aside for data sharing efforts that will benefit potential secondary data users, the entire research community, and the originating study group. However in some cases, a study group may find themselves with a particularly low level of resources available to devote to data sharing efforts at the time they begin to consider fulfilling data sharing requirements attached to their study. They may for example have started out with a pretty tight study budget, or have already spent down most or all of the study budget, or have staff turnover that makes it difficult to spare person-time to the effort. Determining whether your study group may be in a more common position of having a standard level of resources available for data-sharing efforts, or whether your study group may be in the less common position of having a very low level of resources available will help guide you in determining how you will annotate the data and non-data supporting files/resources in your data package.

A data package contains the following: Research data files or links to data files accessible or stored elsewhere Non-data, supporting files such as protocols, data collection instruments, code for manipulating or analyzing the data, discipline-specific metadata files describing the data, and additional documentation Standard data package metadata files that are both human- and machine-readable Shareable data package \u00b6 A shareable data package is a version of the data package that has been prepared for submission to a public data repository, and meets the following three requirements: All of the files are intended for sharing, possibly under a data use agreement (DUA) or specific set of restrictions. Sufficient information on the provenance and terms of use are included to make the data reusable. Sufficient metadata and documentation are included so that the package may be used by a researcher unconnected to and without special knowledge of the original study. Producing a shareable data package & Other important points \u00b6 Typically, a data package can be converted to a shareable data package simply by redacting any items that cannot be shared, replacing them with an appropriate substitute or placeholder whenever possible. For example, a researcher may replace dates within a sensitive dataset with shifted dates or topcode certain variables to help maintain participant confidentiality. Such changes are ideally made prior to analysis so that the original investigator is analyzing the exact same data file(s) that will be shared to facilitate reproduciblity. A common and important case is when none of the data can be shared, and thus all of the data file(s) must be excluded from the shareable data package. For example, a research project may exclusively be analyzing secondary data that, while broadly accessible, may not be redistributed (research data available from public repositories often falls into this category). In such cases, the data may be physically stored outside the shareable data package and replaced with a link to the data; the resulting shareable data package may then be shared with and used by researchers who independently obtain access to the data. In this way, one may think of a shareable data package as supporting the use a particular dataset for a specific purpose (e.g. replicating an analysis performed by the authors of the data package), whether are not the data themselves are contained in the package . Metadata files provide context and usability \u00b6 Data sharing requirements by funders or journals are often stated in general terms only (e.g., \"You must share all data underlying published results\"). This creates two problems: (1) a researcher may nominally comply by simply sharing his or her existing files, which may or may not be useable by others; and (2) it leads researchers to focus on the data only, to the exclusion of metadata and other resources (e.g. codebooks, code) that are needed to use the data effectively and/or increase their scientific value. Aside from the data themselves, it is important for investigators to provide context and usability information, including: what questions was the study group trying to answer in collecting the data, how did they design study experiment(s)/activity(s) to answer those questions, how was data collected, what data was collected, what is in each data file, how to use it, how it relates to other data files, how it relates to published results, etc. In fact, supporting or metadata files that include this context and usability information are arguably as or more important than the data itself . Without the context information, it is difficult for potential secondary data users or collaborators to get even a high-level sense of whether it may be productive to request access to study data or to reach out regarding a collaboration with the originating study group. Without the usability information, it is difficult for potential secondary data users or collaborators to get a more granular view of whether the collected data may be usable for their secondary data use purposes, and it may be difficult or impossible to understand and actually use the data for their secondary data use purpose. Some research communities have clear standards for how to create and provide at least some of the critical metadata required to ensure discoverability, understanding, and usability of commonly collected data types (e.g. neuroimaging, genomice, GIS) or datasets collected in the course of a commonly conducted study type (e.g. clinical trial). These standards are incredibly valuable and essential for detailed discovery and reuse of especially very complex data and study types. Research communities should always be in charge of forging the standards very specific to their own community as they are, indeed, the only ones with the deep knowledge and experience to do so. Standard Data Package Metadata as a bridge across communities \u00b6 However, especially in the context of an effort like the NIH HEAL Initiative, which spans many research communities (e.g. pain, opioids, basic science, pre-clinical, clinical, wet-lab, computational, materials and methods development, community-based, surveys, observational, qualitative, pharma, business development), and seeks to promote discoverability, interpretability, and usability of all funded research across these communities, and by both researchers and a broader audience (e.g. community-members, community-based organizations, journalists), research community specific standards alone may fall short of enabling full discoverability, interpretability, and usability across this wide spectrum of data and knowledge producers and consumers, due to: Within specific research community standards Inconsistent or missing content or format recommendations impacting data types, datasets, and data collections collected within the context of the specific research community E.g. A standard specifies the need for a data dictionary, but does not provide further specification, so that some people provide it as a PDF, others as a Word document, and still others as an Excel document with a header row containing explanatory notes Across specific research community standards No one specific research community standard can be adopted by all communities It would miss standards needed by other communities It would require or recommend standards not needed or even nonsensical for other communities If each community adopted their own community specific standard and did nothing else , there would be a lack of discoverability and usability across communities Some communities lack clear standards, and so would implement no or inconsistent/ad hoc standards Inward-facing research community specific standards may assume knowledge and understanding that cannot be taken for granted outside of that community both with respect to organization of data and metadata, and with respect to terminology used to describe it Inconsistent content or format recommendations across research communities - E.g. Many community standards require a description of the overall study in some format, however the content and format varies - some specify to provide this is a readme.txt document, others as entered into structured forms such as when registering a clinical trial on clinicaltrials.gov or a genomic study on dbGaP , and still others do not specify a format; content varies across all of these examples The HEAL Initiative has developed Standard Data Package Metadata and best practices as to when and how to implement these metadata, to be leveraged by all studies across all research communities, as a way to bridge across research communities and other data and knowledge producer and consumer communities. Standard Data Package Metadata are a small set of standard metadata file types that, altogether, provide essential usability and context information about the study as a whole and about the data files your study has produced/collected. These metadata files should be included in all HEAL Initiative data packages. They produce a common language and universally understandable structure for all studies across the spectrum of research communities that are a part of the HEAL Initiative. These are not meant to replace or supercede research community specific standards. Rather, they are meant to fully accommodate, never conflict with, and lightly add value to research community specific metadata standards.","title":"What is a data package?"},{"location":"overview/what/#what-is-a-data-package","text":"","title":"What is a data package?"},{"location":"overview/what/#data-package","text":"A data package is a stand-alone collection of research data and supporting files.

The objective is to list all variables and descriptive information about those variables. This will ensure that potential secondary data users know what data has been collected or calculated and how to use these data. Note that a given study can have multiple tabular data files; You should create a data dictionary for each tabular data file. Thus, a study may have multiple data dictionaries. Highly encouraged Only name and description properties are required. For categorical variables, constraints.enum and enumLabels (where applicable) properties are highly encouraged. For studies using HEAL or other common data elements (CDEs), standardsMappings information is highly encouraged. type and format properties may be particularly useful for some variable types (e.g. date-like variables) Properties (i.e., fields or variables) \u00b6 schemaVersion (string) The version of the schema used in agreed upon convention of major.minor.path (e.g., 1.0.2) NOTE: This is NOT for versioning of each indiviual data dictionary instance. Rather, it is the version of THIS schema document. See version property (below) if specifying the individual data dictionary instance version. If generating a vlmd document as a csv file, include this version in every row/record to indicate this is a schema level property (not applicable for the json version as this property is already at the schema/root level) Examples: 1.0.0 0.2.0 section (string) The section, form, survey instrument, set of measures or other broad category used to group variables. Previously called \"module.\" Examples: Demographics PROMIS Medical History name (string,required) The name of a variable (i.e., field) as it appears in the data. Examples: gender_id title (string) The human-readable title or label of the variable. Examples: Gender identity description (string,required) An extended description of the variable. This could be the definition of a variable or the question text (e.g., if a survey). Examples: The participant's age at the time of study enrollment What is the highest grade or level of school you have completed or the highest degree you have received? type (string) A classification or category of a particular data element or property expected or allowed in the dataset. Must be one of: number , integer , string , any , boolean , date , datetime , time , year , yearmonth , duration , geopoint format (string) Indicates the format of the type specified in the type property. Each format is dependent on the type specified. See here for more information about appropriate format values by variable type . constraints.required (boolean) If this variable is marked as true, then this variable's value must be present (ie not missing; see missingValues). If marked as false or not present, then the variable CAN be missing. constraints.maxLength (integer) Indicates the maximum length of an iterable (e.g., array, string, or object). For example, if 'Hello World' is the longest value of a categorical variable, this would be a maxLength of 11. constraints.enum (string) Constrains possible values to a set of values. Examples: 1|2|3|4|5 Poor|Fair|Good|Very good|Excellent constraints.pattern (string) A regular expression pattern the data MUST conform to. constraints.maximum (integer) Specifies the maximum value of a field (e.g., maximum -- or most recent -- date, maximum integer etc).

People will have different goals in sharing their study data, which can be dictated by a number of factors such as the nature of the data, resource and time constraints, and investigator preference. There are three main orientations. You do not have to pick just one of these orientations, although results-support is more likely to stand alone. For example, investigators may be interested in sharing a specific dataset in addition to data on their materials and methods. See more about each data sharing orientation below. Results-support This orientation is for investigators who are interested only in fulfilling the requirement to share the data that is necessary to reproduce their results. Example Your study is complete, and you have very limited time or resources budgeted for data sharing. You have published a manuscript on your results or are in the process of submitting one. You want to fulfill the minimum data sharing requirements, so you will only share the data required to reproduce the manuscript results. If this best describes your data sharing orientation, click [here](resultsupp.md). Dataset-oriented This orientation is for investigators who are interested in sharing a specific set of data or as much data as possible so that other researchers can get additional value from them, such as conducting additional research and analyes beyond the original study's focus. Example Your study is collecting RNA expression data. You are only focusing on a small subset of the collected data for your study, but you would like to be able to share as much of this data as possible so that other investigators can comb through the rich data for other analyses and insight. If this best describes your data sharing orientation, click here. Materials- and methods-oriented This orientation is for investigators who are inteersted in sharing inforamtion about their materials and methods that would allow others to reproduce or build upon them in future research. Example Your study is building an organ-on-a-chip model. You want to share information about the formulation of the chip and results demonstrating that the chip performs similarly as the organ in vivo, so that other investigators can understand the process and reassemble and build upon your successful model in future research.

Study files/resources \u00b6 All data and non-data supporting files/documents/resources generated by or for or otherwise associated with your study, regardless of whether you are planning to share them. Also known as: study resources, study files, study documents, study artefacts. NOTE: For most studies, study resources will all be files. However for some studies, this may also include (for example) bio samples or other non-file items. Associated Files/Dependencies \u00b6 The term Associated Files/Dependencies may be used with respect to a Resource (i.e. study file/resource ) or with respect to a Result (i.e. final result product ). Resource When adding a study file/resource to your study's Resource Tracker , you will be asked to supply Associated Files/Dependencies for that study file/resource. An Associated File/Dependency, is any file that the current study file/resource depends on to be interpreted, replicated, or used. For example, consider a processed tabular data file (e.g. a final analytic dataset): a raw data file(s) , plus a code file that merges and cleans the raw data file(s) may be required to replicate the processed tabular data file, and a data dictionary for the processed tabular data file is likely to be required to interpret/use the processed tabular data file. Note Data dictionaries and protocols should be shared in the more specific Associated Data Dictionary , Associated Protocol fields in the Resource Tracker wherever possible When adding a publication or report to the Resource Tracker, the only dependency should be the Results Tracker for the publication, and the associated Results Tracker for the publication should be added in the more specific Associated Results Tracker field in the Resource Tracker wherever possible Result When adding a final result product to your study's Results Tracker , you will be asked to supply Associated Files/Dependencies for that result. An Associated File/Dependency, is any file that the current result depends on to be interpreted, replicated, or used. For example, consider a figure that has been created as a potential candidate for inclusion as Figure 1A (in the context of a Figure 1 with panels A, B, and C) in a draft manuscript: a png or jpg image file exported from Corel Draw or Illustrator may directly underly the whole of Figure 1 (where image files for panel A, B, and C were formatted into a single Figure 1 in the context of a Corel Draw or Illustrator file ); a png or jpg image file produced and written to file by R or python code may directly underly specifically Figure 1A; this image file in turn depends upon the code file that produced it, as well as the data file(s) the code file read in and operated upon to create the final image file; the code file may have been created to implement a specific statistical analysis plan that is laid out in a larger study protocol file , or in a statistical analysis plan file ; the data in the data file may have been collected using a protocol laid out in a specific protocol file , and if the data file(s) underlying the result in 1A is/are tabular data file(s), a data dictionary for the data file(s) is likely to be required to interpret/use the data file(s) Note When listing Associated Files/Dependencies for a result in the Results Tracker, start by following the full dependency trail backwards from the result, as demonstrated in the example above Specifically, think about all Associated Files/Dependencies directly underlying or associated with the result, then the Associated Files/Dependencies directly underlying those files, etc. Continue this \"stepping backwards\" process until the files you are listing as Associated Files/Dependencies have no direct Associated Files/Dependencies themselves List all of these files as Associated Files/Dependencies for the result in the Results Tracker Associated Data Dictionary \u00b6 The Data Dictionary that inventories and provides detailed information regarding all variables in the specific tabular data file for which it is the Associated Data Dictionary. Associated Protocol \u00b6 Placeholder Associated Results Tracker \u00b6 The Results Tracker that inventories and provides detailed information regarding all final result products (e.g. figures, figure panels, tables, text statements) shared in the specific publication or report for which it is the Associated Results Tracker. Final Result Products \u00b6 A figure, figure panel, table, or text statement that communicates a result and is, will, or may be shared in the context of a publication, report or presentation dsc-pkg Folder \u00b6 A file folder/directory that will hold all of the Standard Data Package Metadata Files for your Data Package . It is generally recommended that you create a single overarching study file folder/directory to hold all study files and folders and that you create your dsc-pkg folder as a direct sub-directory of your study folder and name it \"dsc-pkg\". Standard data package metadata files \u00b6 Standard metadata file types that, altogether, provide essential usability and context information about the study as a whole and about the data files your study has produced/collected. These metadata files should be included in all data packages . They should be stored together in a single file directory, preferably as a sub-directory within your study file directory called \"dsc-pkg\". See below for an example directory structure.

Each row of the results tracker corresponds to one result (e.g. a figure, table, or textual statement) within a publication or report. Information in the tracker about each result includes the type of result (figure, table, text), description, and dependencies (i.e. files necessary to interpret, replicate, or use the result). The Results Tracker is one of the standard data package metadata files which should always be included in a data package to provide essential usability and context information about the study as a whole and about the data files your study has produced/collected.

Please follow the links below for additional information on: Standard data package metadata files Standard data package metadata files - File-level Results Tracker overview Results Tracker csv template Results Tracker schema/field definitions Minimal annotation \u00b6 When completing the Resource Tracker for your study : Minimal annotation implies that you will list and annotate relevant study resources in the resource tracker ONLY if you will share those files in a public data repository When completing the Resource Tracker you will NOT list and annotate relevant study files if they will not be shared in a public data repository See the alternative: Wholistic Annotation Advantages You only catalog the data and non-data supporting files that you will share/submit to a repository. Especially if you are late in your study, Minimal Annotation may be less time consuming than the alternative (Wholistic Annotation), because you are listing and annotating fewer files (i.e. only the files that will be shared , versus all files that will be shared AND all files that will NOT be shared) in the Resource Tracker for your study. This approach still provides a lot of value to researchers who may find your study - It will help them to parse what the study was trying to do, how the study was designed, what has been made available, whether or not the data that has been made available may be useful for their purposes (e.g. secondary data analysis, comparison to their own results, etc.), and even whether it may be useful to reach out to the study group of origin to request data that has not been provided or to set up a formal collaboration. This approach allows you to fulfill minimal data sharing requirements. Caveats As compared to the alternative (Wholistic Annotation), you don\u2019t get the full local annotation benefit that would come with fully cataloguing all data and non-data/supporting files relevant to a study (including files you will not share/submit to a repository), and how they relate to each other and to published results \u2013 these benefits include facilitating continuity and passed-down knowledge within study groups , and discovery, sharing, and re-use of the data and knowledge produced by the study outside of the original study group. As compared to the alternative (Wholistic Annotation), you may not get the full benefit of added study discoverability and transparencty for potential secondary data users and collaborators that the Resource Tracker can provide. Wholistic annotation \u00b6 When completing the Resource Tracker for your study : Wholistic annotation implies that you will list and annotate relevant study resources without regard for whether (or not) you will share those files in a public data repository When completing the Resource Tracker you will list and annotate relevant study files that will be shared AND those that will NOT be shared When listing/annotating a file that will NOT be shared, access level should be set to \"permanent-private\" to indicate that the file will not be shared See the alternative: Minimal Annotation Advantages Maximizes transparency and allows other researchers interested in the data to understand the full scope of the project and the data when accessing study documentation. allows for documentation of the existence and disposition of files that are too sensitive to share but are important for reproducibility and can perhaps be requested directly from the study team by another researcher. You get the benefit of full local annotation, which not only maximizes the usefulness of your data for other investigators but also can be helpful internally, especially in preserving knowledge about the data even as team members may change over the course of the study. Documenting and sharing all metadata associated with your study can increase the discoverability of your study. Caveats Especially if you are late in your study, Wholistic Annotation may be more time consuming than the alternative (Minimal Annotation), because you are listing and annotating more files (i.e. files that will be shared AND files that will NOT be shared, versus ONLY files that will be shared) in the Resource Tracker for your study. As-you-go annotation \u00b6 As-you-go annotation implies that you will begin the data packaging and annotation process right away; you will audit and annotate all study resources already created, and keep up with annotation as you move through the remainder of your study timeline; you will generally audit and annotate all study resources regardless of whether these resources will ultimately be shared at a public data repository ( \"wholistic\" annotation ) See the alternative: Top-down Annotation As you move through the data packaging process steps , \"as-you-go\" annotation implies that you will : Audit relevant files start this right away audit all files/resources already collected or produced by or for your study determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation) Organize and consistently name your files and folders start this right away consider using HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming study files/resources to establish naming and organization conventions that should be followed for all study files, including for files that already exist and for new study files/resources as they are collected or produced align file name/organization of existing study files to the conventions you established in the step above - this may require you to change file names and locations for already-existing files (NOTE: do not duplicate files in order to align with name/org conventions as this may lead to confusion down the road as to which copy is the \"source of truth\") Add Standard data package metadata - File-level Data Dictionary start this right away audit existing study files to identify any tabular data files that may have already been collected or produced by or for the study create a data dictionary for any existing tabular data files right away if/when any new tabular data files are collected or produced by or for the study, create a data dictionary for the new tabular data file(s) right away and save them using file name and organization conventions you have established for your study (see step 2 above) Results Tracker start this right away : determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation) wait until your study is at the point of producing final result products (e.g. figures, tables, text statements) once your study has reached this point, and if your study has determined that a data sharing goal of the study is to provide results-support , start annotating final result products right away, even if you have not formally begun to add them to a publication or report as new final result products are produced by your study, annotate each final result product right away once your study has started to formally add final results to a publication, start adding result annotation files you've already produced (in the step just above) to a results tracker document for the publication - one results tracker per publication as new publications or reports are produced by your study, use the result annotation files you create for each final result product in the publication to create a results tracker document for the new publication Add Standard data package metadata - Study-level Experiment Tracker start this right away audit all component experiments or other activities that will be part of your study start annotating study component experiments or activities that have already been designed if/when any new study component experiments or activities are designed, annotate each new study component experiment or activity right away Resource Tracker start this right away audit all files/resources already collected or produced by or for your study (see step 1 above) establish file naming and organization conventions for your study files and make any necessary adjustments to current study file naming/organization to align with these conventions (see step 2 above) systematically annotate all files/resources already collected or produced by or for your study right away once you've annotated all files/resources already produced by or for your study, add these resource annotation files to your resource tracker as new files/resources are collected or produced by or for your study, save them using the file naming and organization conventions you established previously, and annotate each new resource right away Advantages Spreads out annotation and data packaging work across the course of the study so that burden at the end of the stusy is minimal. You get the benefit of full local annotation, which not only maximizes the usefulness of your data for other investigators but also can be helpful internally, especially in preserving knowledge about the data even as team members may change over the course of the study. Maximizes transparency and allows other researchers interested in the data to understand the full scope of the project and the data when accessing study documentation. Allows for documentation of the existence and disposition of files that are too sensitive to share but are important for reproducibility and can perhaps be requested directly from the study team by another researcher. Documenting and sharing all metadata associated with your study can increase the discoverability of your study. Caveats The \"as-you-go\" annotation approach, **when applied broadly as outlined above** is strongly recommended for study groups that are early on in their study as the burden of starting up is relatively light when few study files/resources have so far been collected or produced by or for the study. However, the start up burden of this approach may be quite substantial for studies groups that are late or even well into their study and have already accumulated many study files/resources, and we generally recommend these groups consider the alternative, more goal-focused and narrow annotation approach: [Top-down annotation](#top-down-annotation). **The \"as-you-go\" annotation approach may also be applied in a narrower sense**, especially by study groups that are later in their study and who will not apply the \"as-you-go\" annotation approach in the broadest sense. This implies that studies will consider the whole packaging overview process and complete items as they can, as opposed to waiting until the very end (for example, when they are about to submit a study manuscript for peer review) to start the process. Some examples include, 1) auditing study files for tabular data files, creating data dictionaries for existing tabular data files right away, and creating data dictionaries right away for new tabular data files as the study collects or produces them, 2) annotating final result products the study group knows will or likely will be included in a final manuscript as they are produced, and creating a results tracker for final manuscript documents as drafts begin to be forumulated by the study group, 3) annotating component experiments and other activities that are part of the study right away if already designed, or as soon as they are designed (especially if it is clear that the experiment or activity will or likely will produce data that will be used to support/produce final result products that will be included in a final manuscript). Top-down annotation \u00b6 Top-down annotation implies that you will generally implement the data packaging and annotation process in a somewhat narrower, more goal-oriented manner as compared to how you would implement if using the alternative As-you-go annotation approach; You will generally determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation), then wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product (i.e. respectively, the final result product(s) or manuscripts containing a set of final result product(s) for which your data sharing will provide support, or the final dataset your study is interested in sharing/disseminating); you will then audit and annotate the subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the results or dataset already created, and annotate this subset of study resources right away; when you take the \"top down\" annotation approach, you will generally audit the full subset of study resources required to support your result(s) and/or dataset regardless of whether these resources will ultimately be shared at a public data repository, however you may choose to 1) annotate all resources in this subset regardless of whether they will be shared in a public repository ( \"wholistic\" annotation ), or 2) annotate only the resources in this subset that will be shared in a public repository ( \"minimal\" annotation ) See the alternative: As-you-go Annotation As you move through the data packaging process steps , \"top-down\" annotation implies that you will : Audit relevant files start this right away : determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation) wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product (i.e. respectively, the final result product(s) or manuscripts containing a set of final result product(s) for which your data sharing will provide support, or the final dataset your study is interested in sharing/disseminating) audit the full subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the goal sharing product(s) (i.e. final study result product(s)/manuscipt(s) or dataset) Organize and consistently name your files and folders start this right away : determine if you are early in your study if you are early in your study: consider using HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming study files/resources to establish naming and organization conventions that should be followed for all study files, including for files that already exist and for new study files/resources as they are collected or produced align file name/organization of existing study files to the conventions you established in the step above - this may require you to change file names and locations for already-existing files (NOTE: do not duplicate files in order to align with name/org conventions as this may lead to confusion down the road as to which copy is the \"source of truth\") if you are late in your study: we generally recommend that you leave file names and organization as is you may use the approach laid out above for those early in their study, however if you are late in your study and have accumulated many study files already, establishing file naming and organization conventions now and back-applying them may be quite burdensome and potentially prone to error if you have sets of \"like\" files (e.g. a similarly formatted tabular data file or brain imaging file per study subject per study timepoint), it may be well worth establishing file naming and organization conventions based on HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming study files/resources now and back-applying them just for these file sets - doing so will make it possible/easier to annotate these file sets in one go instead of annotating them singly one at a time, and so may substantially reduce annotation/data-sharing burden for the study group Add Standard data package metadata - File-level Data Dictionary start this right away : determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation) wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product (i.e. respectively, the final result product(s) or manuscripts containing a set of final result product(s) for which your data sharing will provide support, or the final dataset your study is interested in sharing/disseminating) audit the full subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the goal sharing product(s) (i.e. final study result product(s)/manuscipt(s) or dataset) among this subset of files, identify any tabular data files create a data dictionary for these tabular data files right away Results Tracker start this right away : determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation) wait until your study is at the point of producing final result products (e.g. figures, tables, text statements) once your study has reached this point, and if your study has determined that a data sharing goal of the study is to provide results-support , start annotating final result products right away that are likely to be included in a final manuscript or report you will share and for which you would like to provide results-support, even if you have not formally begun to add them to a publication or report as new final result products are produced by your study, annotate each final result product right away once your study has started to formally add final results to a publication, start adding result annotation files you've already produced (in the step just above) to a results tracker document for the publication - one results tracker per publication as new publications are produced by your study, use the result annotation files you create for each final result product in the publication or report to create a results tracker document for the new publication or report alternatively, you may wait until your study is at the point of a final manuscript or report for which you would like to provide results-support; then start annotating only the final result products that are positively contained in this publication Add Standard data package metadata - Study-level Experiment Tracker start this right away OR wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product audit all component experiments or other activities that are or will be part of your study identify the subset of component experiments or other activities that positively produced or are likely to produce data or other products that are required to interpret, use, or reproduce your goal data sharing product (i.e. final result product(s), manuscripts, or a dataset you want to share/disseminate) start annotating this subset of study component experiments or activities if they have already been designed if/when any new study component experiments or activities are designed and it is determined that the new experiment/activity produced or is likely to produce data or other products that are required to interpret, use, or reproduce your goal data sharing product, annotate this new study component experiment(s) or activity(s) right away Resource Tracker wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product (i.e. final result product(s), manuscripts, or a dataset you want to share/disseminate) audit the full subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the goal sharing product(s) (i.e. final study result product(s)/manuscipt(s) or dataset) (see step 1 above) starting with your goal data sharing product (i.e. manuscript, or a dataset you want to share/disseminate), systematically annotate either : all files/resources in this subset of study resources regardless of whether they will be shared in a public data repository ( \"wholistic\" annotation ) only the files/resources in this subset of study resources that will be shared in a public data repository ( \"minimal\" annotation ) once you've annotated all files/resources, add these resource annotation files to your resource tracker Advantages \"Top-down\" annotation allows for a narrower and more goal-focused approach to annotation and data-sharing as compared to the alternative \"As-you-go\" annotation; This approach may be very appealing to study groups that are well into their study as it reduces annotation and data sharing burden by focusing on producing the essential annotation needed to ensure that the results or datasets they share are discoverable, interpretable, reusable, and replicable by researchers and other potential collaborators. Concentrates annotation and data packaging work at the end of the study which allows singular focus on the task and may speed the process. If you choose to use \"wholistic\" annotation with the \"top-down\" annotation approach, you get the benefit of full local annotation of the files underlying your study's goal data sharing product (manuscript results or shared dataset), which not only maximizes the usefulness of your data for other investigators but also can be helpful internally, especially in preserving knowledge about the data even as team members may change over the course of the study. Even if you choose to use \"minimal\" annotation with the \"top down\" approach you still get the benefit of some local annotation to support preserving institutional knowledge within your study group. If you choose to use \"wholistic\" annotation with the \"top-down\" annotation approach, you maximize transparency and allow other researchers interested in the data to understand the full scope of the project and the data that explicitly underlies your study's goal data sharing product (manuscript results or shared dataset) when accessing study documentation. Even if you choose to use \"minimal\" annotation with the \"top down\" approach you still provide a lot of transparency about what data and non-data supporting files you are sharing to support your study's goal data sharing product, how these files relate to each other and how to use and interpret these files; this presents a huge value to potential secondary data users or collaborators. If you choose to use \"wholistic\" annotation with the \"top-down\" annotation approach, this still allows for documentation of the existence and disposition of files that are too sensitive to share but are important for reproducibility, interpretability and use of the study's goal data sharing product (manuscript results or shared dataset) and can perhaps be requested directly from the study team by another researcher. If you choose to use \"wholistic\" annotation with the \"top-down\" annotation approach, this allows for documenting and sharing all metadata associated with the study's goal data sharing product (manuscript results or shared dataset) and this can increase the discoverability of your study. Caveats Placeholder Placeholder Data Package \u00b6 Placeholder Shareable Data Package \u00b6 Placeholder Data-sharing Orientation \u00b6 A study group's goal(s) for data-sharing. People will have different goals in sharing data and non-data supporting files/resources from their study. These goals, or 'orientations' may be dictated by a number of factors such as the nature of the data, study staff resources and time constraints, investigator preference, and requirements imposed by a funder, journal, or other entity somehow governing the study. Determining what your goals are for data sharing will help guide you in determining what you will include in your data package and how and when you will annotate the data and non-data supporting files/resources in your data package. There are two main data-sharing \"orientations.\" These data sharing goals or \"orientations\" are not mutually exclusive. You may choose both Results-support and Dataset-sharing as goals for your study's data sharing goal. Results-support \u00b6 The study group wants to share data and non-data supporting files specifically to support results shared in a published manuscript or other venue (e.g. presentation, poster, report, etc.) They will share items required to interpret, replicate, or use these results Dataset-sharing \u00b6 The study group wants to share a specific dataset(s); perhaps the group has collected/created a very rich dataset and used this dataset to ask and publish results related to specific scientific questions; they believe other study groups may be able to leverage this dataset to ask and publish results related to other scientific questions that may be related or unrelated to the questions the dataset was originally collected to help investigate The study group wants to share this specific dataset(s), as well as the data and non-data supporting files specifically to support use of this dataset(s) They will share items required to interpret, replicate, or use this dataset(s)","title":"Terms and Concepts"},{"location":"terms/#terms-and-concepts","text":"","title":"Terms and Concepts"},{"location":"terms/#tabular-data-file","text":"A data file that is organized in a table with rows and columns.","title":"Tabular data file"},{"location":"terms/#study-filesresources","text":"All data and non-data supporting files/documents/resources generated by or for or otherwise associated with your study, regardless of whether you are planning to share them.

Resource When adding a study file/resource to your study's Resource Tracker , you will be asked to supply Associated Files/Dependencies for that study file/resource. An Associated File/Dependency, is any file that the current study file/resource depends on to be interpreted, replicated, or used. For example, consider a processed tabular data file (e.g. a final analytic dataset): a raw data file(s) , plus a code file that merges and cleans the raw data file(s) may be required to replicate the processed tabular data file, and a data dictionary for the processed tabular data file is likely to be required to interpret/use the processed tabular data file. Note Data dictionaries and protocols should be shared in the more specific Associated Data Dictionary , Associated Protocol fields in the Resource Tracker wherever possible When adding a publication or report to the Resource Tracker, the only dependency should be the Results Tracker for the publication, and the associated Results Tracker for the publication should be added in the more specific Associated Results Tracker field in the Resource Tracker wherever possible Result When adding a final result product to your study's Results Tracker , you will be asked to supply Associated Files/Dependencies for that result. An Associated File/Dependency, is any file that the current result depends on to be interpreted, replicated, or used.

Caveats The \"as-you-go\" annotation approach, **when applied broadly as outlined above** is strongly recommended for study groups that are early on in their study as the burden of starting up is relatively light when few study files/resources have so far been collected or produced by or for the study. However, the start up burden of this approach may be quite substantial for studies groups that are late or even well into their study and have already accumulated many study files/resources, and we generally recommend these groups consider the alternative, more goal-focused and narrow annotation approach: [Top-down annotation](#top-down-annotation). **The \"as-you-go\" annotation approach may also be applied in a narrower sense**, especially by study groups that are later in their study and who will not apply the \"as-you-go\" annotation approach in the broadest sense. This implies that studies will consider the whole packaging overview process and complete items as they can, as opposed to waiting until the very end (for example, when they are about to submit a study manuscript for peer review) to start the process. Some examples include, 1) auditing study files for tabular data files, creating data dictionaries for existing tabular data files right away, and creating data dictionaries right away for new tabular data files as the study collects or produces them, 2) annotating final result products the study group knows will or likely will be included in a final manuscript as they are produced, and creating a results tracker for final manuscript documents as drafts begin to be forumulated by the study group, 3) annotating component experiments and other activities that are part of the study right away if already designed, or as soon as they are designed (especially if it is clear that the experiment or activity will or likely will produce data that will be used to support/produce final result products that will be included in a final manuscript).","title":"As-you-go annotation"},{"location":"terms/#top-down-annotation","text":"Top-down annotation implies that you will generally implement the data packaging and annotation process in a somewhat narrower, more goal-oriented manner as compared to how you would implement if using the alternative As-you-go annotation approach; You will generally determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation), then wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product (i.e. respectively, the final result product(s) or manuscripts containing a set of final result product(s) for which your data sharing will provide support, or the final dataset your study is interested in sharing/disseminating); you will then audit and annotate the subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the results or dataset already created, and annotate this subset of study resources right away; when you take the \"top down\" annotation approach, you will generally audit the full subset of study resources required to support your result(s) and/or dataset regardless of whether these resources will ultimately be shared at a public data repository, however you may choose to 1) annotate all resources in this subset regardless of whether they will be shared in a public repository ( \"wholistic\" annotation ), or 2) annotate only the resources in this subset that will be shared in a public repository ( \"minimal\" annotation ) See the alternative: As-you-go Annotation As you move through the data packaging process steps , \"top-down\" annotation implies that you will : Audit relevant files start this right away : determine the data-sharing orientation(s) or goal(s) of your study right away (results-support orientation and/or dataset-sharing orientation) wait until your study has produced the goal sharing product (i.e. respectively, the final result product(s) or manuscripts containing a set of final result product(s) for which your data sharing will provide support, or the final dataset your study is interested in sharing/disseminating) audit the full subset of study resources required to interpret, use, and/or reproduce the goal sharing product(s) (i.e. final study result product(s)/manuscipt(s) or dataset) Organize and consistently name your files and folders start this right away : determine if you are early in your study if you are early in your study: consider using HEAL recommendations for organizing and naming study files/resources to establish naming and organization conventions that should be followed for all study files, including for files that already exist and for new study files/resources as they are collected or produced align file name/organization of existing study files to the conventions you established in the step above -

In general, minimize the number of folders at each level, and the number of 'layers' of your whole directory. File naming conventions can often be used quite effectively to 'organize' files and to provide clues as to what the files are and how they relate to each other without resorting to using separation into different directories to serve that purpose. However, there is a limit to naming conventions, and you may want to separate your files into directors based on some type of logical groupings and/or based on th elevel or timing of access to the files you expect to provide. See below for further details. Reminder Before creating more directories or directory layers, consider whether file-naming conventions may be used more efficiently to create this organization. Create logical groupings \u00b6 There are a number of ways to group files logically. Below are some examples of how you can logically group your files in folder structures: Grouping strategy Examples By file category Raw data grouped together; processed data grouped together; protocols grouped together; data dictionaries grouped together By experimental subject All raw data files from a particular cell (across all protocols grouped together, etc.) By type of experiment All current clamp experiment files grouped together; all voltage clamp experiment files grouped together By experiment All raw data files mkdocsfrom a particular protocol, across all cells to which the protocol applies, grouped together By file type All CorelDraw figure files grouped together By expected use All files you expect a primary or secondary user of the data/metadata would want to use and/or cite together (as a package) - for example, grouping files that you expect you will want to provide different levels of access to/access restrictions for and/or that you want to provide access to with different timing. See below for more information on access level and timing. Consistently name your files and folders \u00b6 Universal conventions \u00b6 File and folder names should generally be informative/descriptive Wherever possible name your files and folders in a way that will let a human user reasonably infer quite a lot about what the file holds without any further information It is very helpful if file and folder names are all lower case Don't use spaces or special characters Preferred separator is a dash ('-'), e.g., my-data-file-1 Special conventions \u00b6 If you have multiple files or folders of the same type , choose a naming convention that's descriptive, and not unmanageably long, and be consistent. For example: One file per day, per cell, per protocol: Potential convention: \"day\"-YYYY-MM-DD-\"cell\"-[0-9]-\"protocol\"-{short-protocol-description} Example filename: day-2023-03-17-cell-3-protocol-200ms-pulse.asc One folder per experimental objective: Potential convention: {cell-type}-{short-experimental-approach-description}-{short-experimental-objective-description} Example foldrer name: drg-current-clamp-effect-of-K1395R-on-drg-neuronal-excitability; drg-voltage-clamp-biophysical-properties-of-K1395R If you have files that are related , choose a naming convention that's descriptive, and not unmanageably long, and be consistent. For example: A tabular/csv data file that has a data dictionary Potential convention: The data dictionary for a data file has the same filename as the data file, with a \"dd-\" prefix Example file name(s): Data file name : my-data-1.csv Corresponding data dictionary file name : dd-my-data-1.csv Several experiments that each have an experimental protocol Potential convention: The protocol of the experiment has the id of that experiment (from the experiment tracker) in the filename, with a \"protocol-\" prefix Example file name(s): Experiment id (from experiment tracker) : exp-1 Corresponding protocol file name : protocol-exp-1.txt","title":"Name"},{"location":"terms/name/#organize-study-related-files-into-folders-with-consistent-naming-conventions","text":"Organize all your files (whether you will share them or not), into folders.

Reminder Before creating more directories or directory layers, consider whether file-naming conventions may be used more efficiently to create this organization.","title":"Organize study-related files into folders with consistent naming conventions"},{"location":"terms/name/#create-logical-groupings","text":"There are a number of ways to group files logically. Below are some examples of how you can logically group your files in folder structures: Grouping strategy Examples By file category Raw data grouped together; processed data grouped together; protocols grouped together; data dictionaries grouped together By experimental subject All raw data files from a particular cell (across all protocols grouped together, etc.) By type of experiment All current clamp experiment files grouped together; all voltage clamp experiment files grouped together By experiment All raw data files mkdocsfrom a particular protocol, across all cells to which the protocol applies, grouped together By file type All CorelDraw figure files grouped together By expected use All files you expect a primary or secondary user of the data/metadata would want to use and/or cite together (as a package) - for example, grouping files that you expect you will want to provide different levels of access to/access restrictions for and/or that you want to provide access to with different timing.
